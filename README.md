ExoPlayer_Tech_Test

This framework Overrides the listeners of a given player. Using those listeners the framework manages information such as count all the times a video is pause or played, the time since the last Resume or pause. It shows that information using Toasts during the video or with an AlertBox when it ends.
This framework also has an option to make HTTP requests (in this case I tried to use Volley since those are fake requests with no information, in a real scenario I would normally use OKHttp).
